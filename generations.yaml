Unlike many competitors, the E53 focused on on-road performance rather than off-road capability, featuring a unibody construction instead of body-on-frame. Engine options ranged from six-cylinders to a 4.8L V8, with all models featuring all-wheel drive. The interior offered premium materials and a driver-focused layout. The first-generation X5 established BMW in the luxury SUV segment and influenced the subsequent development of road-focused premium SUVs."
